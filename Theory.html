        <h2>Preface: Trash of the Week: An Exploration of Waste and Meaning</h2>
        <p>Trash is everywhere, yet it is often invisible. It disappears from our lives the moment we discard it, out of sight and out of mind. But what if we looked closer? What if, instead of ignoring the things we throw away, we paid attention to them, examined their histories, and questioned what they reveal about our habits, our culture, and our values? This project is an attempt to do just that—an exploration of waste, an investigation into what our trash can teach us.</p>
        <p>At first glance, trash may seem like nothing more than a pile of discarded objects, but I’ve come to realize that each item we throw away has a story—where it came from, how it was used, and why it ended up in the bin. Documenting my weekly trash allows me to reflect on consumption habits, appreciate the usefulness of everyday objects, and reconsider sustainability in small but meaningful ways. By categorizing and analyzing my weekly waste, I can identify patterns in my consumption, explore sustainable alternatives, and share my experiences with others who might also want to rethink waste.</p>
   
        <h2>The Meaning Behind Waste: A Cultural and Personal Perspective</h2>
        <p>Our relationship with trash is complex. As Brian Thill discusses in Waste, we often think of waste as something to be removed as quickly as possible, without acknowledging its continued presence in the world. He notes that we rarely consider “the nature and provenance” of objects before they arrive in our hands, let alone after they leave them. This project challenges that assumption. By documenting what I throw away each week, I aim to shift my perspective—and that of my readers—on the significance of the objects we discard.</p>
        <p>This idea is echoed by archaeologist Sarah Newman, who argues that “waste is neither universal nor self-evident”. In her book Unmaking Waste, Newman explores how different cultures have historically managed and repurposed discarded objects. She notes that ancient civilizations often saw waste as something valuable—materials to be reused, reconfigured, or ritualized. This is a stark contrast to modern Western societies, where waste is primarily seen as a burden to be eliminated.
            By examining my own trash, I hope to engage in a similar process of reevaluation, questioning what I consider “useless” and why.</p>
        
        <h2>Trash as Memory: The Personal and Collective Archive</h2>
        <p>Our trash tells a story about who we are. When we discard something, we might think we are erasing its significance, but in reality, we are contributing to an ongoing narrative—one that is both deeply personal and widely shared. Vik Muniz, an artist who works with waste, captures this idea in his Pictures of Garbage series, where he transforms discarded materials into large-scale portraits of the people who collect them. Muniz’s work highlights how waste is not just about disposal but about identity. The objects we throw away are often intimately tied to our daily lives, holding traces of our experiences, routines, and aspirations.</p>
        <p>This project has made me more conscious of that connection. Some items, like an old notebook or an empty shampoo bottle, were used to their full extent, while others, like a broken hanger, were unexpected casualties. Whether I am throwing away a granola bar wrapper, a pair of worn-out shoes, or a dead battery, each object reflects a choice I made—a purchase, a preference, a lifestyle decision. Through this project, I aim to make those choices more visible, both to myself and to others.</p>
        
        <h2>The Environmental Consequences of Discarding Without Thought</h2>
        <p>Beyond the personal significance of waste, there is a broader, more urgent issue: the environmental impact of our throwaway culture. Waste does not simply disappear. It lingers, accumulating in landfills, polluting oceans, and contributing to climate change. According to Newman, the biggest myth about trash is that we have an “away” to send it to. In reality, waste never truly leaves our world—it simply relocates, whether in the form of microplastics in the ocean or toxic chemicals leaching into the soil.</p>
        <p>A study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health highlights the devastating impacts of improper solid waste management, particularly in developing regions. Mismanaged waste can lead to severe health issues, including respiratory problems and water contamination. Understanding this has made me more aware of the consequences of my own waste generation.</p>
        
        <h2>Trash as Art: Finding Beauty in the Discarded</h2>
        <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of waste is its potential for transformation. Muniz’s Pictures of Garbage series is a testament to the creative possibilities of discarded materials. By repurposing waste into art, he challenges viewers to see beauty in the discarded, to recognize the humanity embedded in objects that are often overlooked. This aligns with Thill’s observation that waste is not just about disposal—it is about the stories we attach to things and the ways we choose to remember them.</p>
        <p>Similarly, The Poetics of Dimensions exhibition at San Francisco's Institute of Contemporary Art showcases how discarded materials can be repurposed into thought-provoking artwork. The exhibition features artists who challenge consumerism by transforming waste into sculptures and installations, reminding us that trash can be more than just an endpoint—it can be a beginning.</p>
        <p>Inspired by these ideas, I have started to look at my own trash with a different perspective. What if, instead of seeing an empty notebook as something to be thrown away, I saw it as a potential canvas for something new? What if a broken hanger could be reshaped into something useful? This project is not just about documentation; it is about reimagination. By exploring different ways to interact with waste—through reuse, recycling, or even creative repurposing—I hope to push back against the passive, detached relationship that so many of us have with our discarded items.</p>
    
        <h2>Conclusion: A Call to Reflect on What We Discard</h2>
        <p>It’s easy to ignore what we throw away. The modern world is designed to make waste invisible, whisked away by garbage trucks and hidden in landfills far from view. But ignoring waste does not make it disappear. If anything, it makes the problem worse, allowing us to continue consuming without consequence, discarding without thought.</p>
        <p>This project challenges that mindset. By paying attention to what I throw away each week, I hope to make waste visible again—not just as an environmental issue, but as a personal and cultural phenomenon. As Thill, Newman, and Muniz all illustrate in their work, waste is never just about trash. It is about memory, desire, and identity. It is about the way we live and the impact we leave behind.</p>
        <p>Through this project, I invite others to reflect on their own relationship with waste. What do your discarded items say about you? What could you change if you paid closer attention? The answers to these questions are not always easy, but they are necessary. Because in the end, trash is not just what we throw away. It is a reflection of who we are.</p>
