        </div></div>
        <div style="text-align: center;"></div>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em;">Trash is everywhere, yet it is often invisible. It disappears from our lives the moment we discard it, out of sight and out of mind. But what if we looked closer?
            What if, instead of ignoring the things we throw away, we paid attention to them, examined their histories, and questioned what they reveal about our habits, our culture, and our values?
            This project is an attempt to do just that—an exploration of waste, an investigation into what our trash can teach us.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <h2 id="sec2" style="font-size: 2em;">Overview</h2>
        </div>

        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">This week’s trash collection provided interesting insights into my daily habits, particularly how much of my waste comes from routine activities rather than impulse decisions.
            Compared to last week, when most of my discarded items were random things I found lying around my room, this week’s waste was closely tied to specific moments throughout my day.
            The most surprising realization was how many essential items reached the end of their life span when I needed them the most—whether it was a hanger breaking right before an important interview,
            a pen running out of ink mid-sentence, or batteries failing just as I was about to unwind.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Another pattern I noticed was the mix of planned waste versus unexpected waste. Some items, like my engineering notebook, had served their purpose and were naturally ready for disposal.
            Others, like the empty tissue box, caught me off guard and forced me to improvise. This week made me reflect on how little I think about replacing items before they run out or break—and how small changes in planning could make my life a little more convenient.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Group 1: The Unexpected Failures</h3>
        </div>
        <ul style="font-size: 1.2em;"></ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;">The Broken Hanger: I used this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothes_hanger">hanger</a> to keep my suit wrinkle-free for an important interview, only for it to snap at the worst moment. It was a cheap plastic hanger, likely weakened over time, but the timing of its failure was frustrating.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;">The Empty Pen: I was mid-interview, taking notes, when my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen">pen</a> suddenly ran out of ink. I had to scramble to find another, which momentarily distracted me. It was a simple black ballpoint pen that had been in my bag for months, but I had never checked how much ink was left.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;">Corroded Batteries: I was excited to unwind with some Xbox after my interview, only to find that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)">batteries</a> in my controller had corroded. I hadn’t touched that controller in a while, and the corrosion was worse than I expected. It reminded me that storing electronics with batteries for too long can lead to damage.</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Group 2: The Fully Used-Up Essentials</h3>
        </div>
        <ul style="font-size: 1.2em;"></ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;">The Empty Shampoo Bottle: After my interview and gaming session, I wanted to freshen up, but my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shampoo">shampoo</a> bottle was completely empty. It was one of those products I used daily but didn’t realize I was running out of until it was too late.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;">The Full Engineering Notebook: I had been using this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook">notebook</a> for my engineering coursework, and after flipping through the last few pages, I realized I had completely filled it up. Unlike the broken hanger or the dead batteries, this was a natural end to an item’s lifespan—but it still caught me off guard.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;">The Empty Tissue Box: I reached for a tissue and found nothing but an empty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_box">box</a>. A minor inconvenience, but one that made me rethink how often I restock basic household supplies.</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Group 3: The Packaging & Leftovers</h3>
        </div>
        <ul style="font-size: 1em;"></ul>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;">Granola Bar Wrapper: A small snack left me with an empty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granola_bar">wrapper</a> that had no further purpose. While individually wrapped snacks are convenient, they also create unnecessary waste.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;">Sweet Box: I was craving something sweet and went to grab a treat, only to find an empty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_sweets_and_desserts">box</a>. It had once been filled with assorted Indian sweets, but I had finished them without realizing it.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 10px;">Used Kitchen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_towel">Tissue</a>: This one was interesting because it wasn’t originally meant to be used.</li></ul>

        <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 20px;">Looking at this week’s trash, I noticed that many of the things I threw away were either completely used up or failed unexpectedly. The biggest takeaway was that a little planning—checking my pen ink before an interview, restocking essential supplies before they run out—could save me from minor inconveniences. I also realized that a lot of my waste comes from single-use packaging, something I want to be more mindful of moving forward.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <h2 id="sec3">Item of the Week: Hanger’s Last Stand</h2>
            <img src="Pics/Brokenhanger.jpeg" alt="Broken Hanger" width="300" height="300">
        </div>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">The hanger takes the spotlight as this week’s "Item of the Week" because it played a critical role in my Honeywell interview preparation. Unfortunately, its structural integrity gave out at the worst possible moment.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em;">The Hanger’s Story</h3>
        </div>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">I bought this plastic hanger a year ago as part of a set, primarily to keep my professional clothes wrinkle-free. It wasn’t expensive, but it served its purpose—until now. I used it to hold my suit for my interview, ensuring I looked polished and ready. However, just before I put my suit on, the hanger snapped.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">This got me thinking about the life cycle of plastic hangers. They’re often mass-produced from non-biodegradable materials, which means they end up in landfills after breaking. Some retailers offer recycling programs, but they are rare. This makes me reconsider purchasing plastic hangers in the future—I may opt for sturdier wooden or metal alternatives that last longer and reduce waste.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Plastic waste is a growing problem, and small changes, like choosing more durable materials, can help minimize unnecessary waste.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">In addition to the environmental impact, the hanger's failure also highlighted the importance of having reliable tools and items, especially during critical moments. Investing in quality products can save time, reduce stress, and ultimately be more cost-effective in the long run.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Reflecting on this experience, I am now more mindful of the items I purchase and their potential longevity. This small incident has inspired me to make more sustainable choices and to be better prepared for future important events.</p>
